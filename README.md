Recommendation System for predicting the effects of change in database on the application running above it.


Problem Domain 

Problem : Most generally occurring Application Design Issue 

  No matter how much pervasive the need and vividness of the requirement of the 

software application is the basic design usually has an application layer or the presentation 

layer middlware layer and a database .The interaction with a software is usually done at 

application layer and the foundation stone of all the services lies intricate dependence with 

the database schema.

        Considering the changes in the requirements some of the dependencies can be 

resolved at the application level itself but if the application level paraphernalia is unable to 

customize the changes inter alia technologies there may be need to bring some change in 

the database schema itself. So the point here is if a change is to be brought upon what is the 

certainity or probability that it will affect the other modules of the application and how much 

profound is the effect on the code itself. This inquisitiveness to acquire information regarding 

the prediction of a change in database schema over the application requires the usage of 

machine learning techniques to embark on the knowledge of the prediction of effects on an 

application. 

	This system makes the recommendation about the effect of database evaluation on the basis of 
forward and backward competibility. This categorise the changes into simple changes(forward and backward competible) and 
complex changes.
